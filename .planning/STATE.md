# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-08)

**Core value:** The bot must be a competitive deathmatch player -- able to perceive enemies, navigate maps, select weapons, aim accurately, and make strategic decisions in real-time on constrained Pi hardware.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Foundation and Characterization

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Foundation and Characterization) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 5
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-08

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 9-phase structure derived from research recommendations, verified against 76 requirements with 100% coverage
- Roadmap: Phase 4 batches reflexes + combat + navigation as peer extractions (no cross-dependencies)
- Roadmap: PERC-08 (sound awareness) assigned to Phase 7 (competitive) since it enables competitive play, not core perception
- [Phase 01]: Used uv dependency-groups for dev deps (modern uv convention)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Primary risk: big-bang refactor breaking the working bot. Mitigated by Phase 1 characterization tests and incremental extraction.
- Tick budget on Pi: every addition must be profiled on Pi hardware, not desktop.
